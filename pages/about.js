                                The Becker family started making organic wine back in 1992 on our small back yard organic vineyard in Port Huron, Michigan. The first grapes from those vines were crushed by the feet of my infant son Christopher, and since this time we dreamed of producing quality organic wines. We moved to Vermont in 1997 and started establishing an organic vineyard. Our goal is to produce small-batch organically farmed wines by hand
